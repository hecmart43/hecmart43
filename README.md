# Hector Martinez Jr.

Computer Science student focused on software engineering, data structures, and systems programming.

## Technical Focus

I am building structured implementations in:

- **C++** (data structures, OOP, memory management)
- **C** (systems-level fundamentals, pointers, structs, file I/O)
- **Java** (object-oriented programming and algorithm design)

## Current Focus

- Strengthening data structure implementation skills
- Writing clean, modular, well-documented code
- Improving algorithmic problem solving
- Preparing for entry-level software engineering roles

## Repositories

- **Cpp-Data-Structures** – Object-oriented design and foundational data structure implementations  
- **C-Programming** – Systems-level programming and memory-focused exercises  
- **Java-OOP-Projects** – Structured Java implementations organized by concept  

## Tools & Environment

- GCC / G++
- Java (Standard JDK)
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows / WSL2

## Goals

Continue building production-style code habits while expanding into more advanced software engineering concepts.
